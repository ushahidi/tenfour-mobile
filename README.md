# rollcall-mobile

I have implemented a basic ionic/cordova wrapper app. This is the minimal amount of work to get an app up-and-running. The app is basically a wrapper around the production app deployed at https://app.rollcall.io/ but is installable and appears as a native app with icon and splashscreen.

RollCall: https://www.rollcall.io/

# Building the app

Built with Ionic: https://ionicframework.com/

`ionic build ios` 

`ionic build android`
